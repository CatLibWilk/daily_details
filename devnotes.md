# persisting state
- componentDidMount sets state based on data pulled from firebase realtime db
- put `onbeforeunload` event listener in DOM during componentdidmount, this saves state to db when window/tab is closed

# 4/14/22 still todo
- monthly cumulative total
~saving the drink/smoke/sub1700 checks to state~
